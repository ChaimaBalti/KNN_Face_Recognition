# KNN Face Recognition

## Overview
The **KNN Face Recognition** project implements a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for face recognition tasks. This project leverages image data to classify faces based on their features extracted from photographs. The KNN algorithm is known for its simplicity and effectiveness in handling classification problems, making it suitable for this face recognition application.

## Features
- **KNN Algorithm**: Implements the KNN algorithm for face classification.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes methods for preprocessing images, such as resizing and normalization.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate model performance using accuracy metrics and confusion matrices.
- **Visualization**: Visualizes the results of face recognition through plots and sample predictions.
